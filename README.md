Smart Labour is all about connecting people who search for work(Workers) and who search for workers(Owners).
We see many people from different parts of the city waiting at a place for work through out the day,if they get work its completely fine,
what if they dont get work.The entire day will be a waste of money energy effort for them.

This is where Smart-Labour comes handy. It actually provides a reservation based system for labour and acts as a medium for people who want work and who want workers to do work.
Workers who want work will search the Owners coloumn and see if they could meet the requirements of Owners.
If they meet the requirements they contact with the telephone number provided. 
Owners who want workers will search the Workers coloumn and see if there are any wokers who could meet the requirements of Owners.
If they meet the requirements they contact with the telephone number provided
